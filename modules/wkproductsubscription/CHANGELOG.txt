Update Policy:
------------------
- Major changed in database and file.

Note: Need to follow this if already using subscription product module -

1- If you are using single shop or multishop without shared group:
    Then admin needs to update only zip file of module new version V5.2.0 because while admin will update zip file then database will be updated automatically and copy the data shop wise.

    Then admin needs to uninstall and DELETE previous version and then upload and install the new version module.
